``export ``

By default all user defined variables are local. They are not exported to new processes. Use export command to export variables and functions to child processes. If no variable names or function names are given, or if the -p option is given, a list of all names that are exported in this shell is printed. An argument of -n says to remove the export property from subsequent NAMEs.
